Java multi threads example to show you how to use Semaphore and Mutex to limit the number of threads to access resources.

Semaphores – Restrict the number of threads that can access a resource. Example, limit max 10 connections to access a file simultaneously.
Mutex – Only one thread to access a resource at once. Example, when a client is accessing a file, no one else should have access the same file at the same time.
