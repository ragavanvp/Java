Syntax of assert statement
#Syntax of an assert statement is as follow (short version):
	
	assert expression1;

 or (full version):
	
	assert expression1 : expression2;

 
#Where:
expression1 must be a boolean expression.
expression2 must return a value (must not return void).

The assert statement is working as follows:

If assertion is enabled, then the assert statement will be evaluated. Otherwise, it does not get executed.
If expression1 is evaluated to false, an AssertionError error is thrown which causes the program stops immediately. And depending on existence of expression2:
If expression2 does not exist, then the AssertionError is thrown with no detail error message.
If expression2 does exist, then a String representation of expression2’s return value is used as detail error message.
If expression1 is evaluate to true, then the program continues normally.
 
Enable assertion
By default, assertion is disabled at runtime. To enable assertion, specify the switch –enableassertions or -ea at command line of java program. 

Ex

public class AssertionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // get a number in the first argument
        int number = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
 
        assert number <= 10; // stops if number > 10
 
        System.out.println("Pass");
 
    }
}
