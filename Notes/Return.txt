The return keyword is used to return from a method 
when its execution is complete. When a return statement is 
reached in a method, the program returns to the code that 
invoked it.

A method can return a value or reference type or 
does not return a value. 
If a method does not return a value, 
the method must be declared void and it doesn’t need to contain a return statement.

If a method declare to return a value, 
then it must use the return statement within the body of method. The data type of the return value must match the method’s declared return type.

The return keyword is used to stop execution of a method and 
return a value for the caller. Usage of this keyword is as following:

return value;

where value is can be of:

A reference of any Java object.
A literal of String, boolean, number or null.


For example:
String getName() {
    return "Peter";
}
 
int getAge() {
    int myAge = 29;
    return myAge;
}
 
Object getObject() {
    Object myObject = new Object();
    // do something with my object...
    return myObject;
}
