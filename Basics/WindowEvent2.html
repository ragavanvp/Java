	James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java
	language project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for
	interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable
	television industry at the time.[26] The language was initially called
	Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the
	project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java
	coffee. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and
	application programmers would find familiar
